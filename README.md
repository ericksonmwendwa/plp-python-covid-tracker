## COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

- This project explores global COVID-19 data to analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across selected countries (Kenya, United States, Germany). Using data visualization and basic analytics, it reveals key patterns, anomalies, and insights from the pandemic response.

## Objectives
- Load and explore the structure of the OWID COVID-19 dataset.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy.
- Visualize trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare countries in terms of daily new cases and vaccination progress.
- Build interactive choropleth maps for global comparisons.
- Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
1. pandas – for data loading, filtering, and manipulation.
2. matplotlib – for static plots and charts.
3. seaborn – for statistical data visualizations.
4. plotly.express – for interactive choropleth maps.
5. Jupyter Notebook – for interactive development and visualization.

## How to run
- Download the dataset: owid-covid-data.csv from Our World in Data.
- Open the notebook file in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Run each cell step-by-step to load data, clean, visualize, and analyze.
- Ensure the following packages are installed: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

## Key Insights
1. The U.S. recorded the highest total cases; Germany had the most effective vaccination rollout.
2. Kenya showed slower vaccine uptake and inconsistent case reporting.
3. Choropleth maps revealed clear global inequality in both case counts and vaccination rates.
4. Data quality varies significantly by country, especially in early pandemic records.

## Reflections
This project reinforced the importance of:
  - Data cleaning in real-world datasets with missing or inconsistent entries.
  - Visualizing trends to spot health disparities across regions.
  - Using interactive tools like Plotly to communicate data effectively.
